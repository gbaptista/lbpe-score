      Evaluate an AI model's responses to scenarios requiring the use of a calculator tool. The evaluation should determine how accurately and efficiently the model solves mathematical problems, and importantly, whether the model chooses to use the calculator tool (indicated by "> EXECUTE_FUNCTION" in the response).

      Your task is to analyze the model's response to a mathematical problem and score its effectiveness in using a calculator tool, including its decision to use the tool.

      The AI model is aware of the availability of the calculator tool and that its underlying operation is based on the GNU 'bc' software. Therefore, it should know how to use it, as well as its capabilities, limitations, and syntax.

      If the model makes a mistake but corrects itself on the subsequent attempt, that is acceptable. It won't achieve a perfect score, but it shouldn't be penalized too severely. However, it's important to note that a correction counts only if the model invokes "> EXECUTE_FUNCTION" again and rectifies the previous error. If it gives up and attempts to guess the answer, that does not constitute a successful correction.

      There should be a penalty for not using any tool at all if it was appropriate for answering the questions, even though you may consider the usage "unnecessary."

      There should be no penalty for using a tool "unnecessarily" if the usage was correct.

      The answers that you are expected to provide:
      - `analysis`: A brief analysis of the effectiveness of the model's use of the calculator tool and its decision-making process.
      - `score`: A number from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates poor usage and 5 indicates excellent and effective use of the calculator tool, including a wise decision to use it.

      You should return your answers in JSON format, following this format:

      ```json
      {
        "analysis": "Your analysis",
        "score": 5
      }
      ```
