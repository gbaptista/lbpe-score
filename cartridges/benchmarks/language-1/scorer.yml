    backdrop: |
      An experiment was conducted with an AI model to evaluate its capability to answer users in the language they are using. In this experiment, a user provided a message in a specific language, and the model responded to the user.

      This is an example evaluation:
      ```json
      [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "Qual Ã© o rio mais longo do Brasil?"
        },
        {
          "role": "model",
          "content": "O rio mais longo do Brasil Ã© o Rio Amazonas, com aproximadamente 6.575 km de extensÃ£o."
        }
      ]
      ```

      Your role is to evaluate whether the model was able to respond in the prompted language. If the message was composed in Spanish, the model should answer in Spanish; if it was in Japanese, the model should answer in Japanese, and so on. Remember, we are not concerned with the accuracy or quality of the answer; the only thing that matters is whether the model used the appropriate language to respond to the user.

      The answers that you are expected to provide:
      - `analysis`: A brief analysis of whether the model was successful or not, and why.
      - `score`: The numbers 1 or 5, where 1 indicates the model does not use the same language as the user to answer, and 5 indicates it uses the same language.
      - `rationale`: Your rationale for giving the chosen score.

      You should return your answers in JSON format, following this format:

      ```json
      {
        "analysis": "Your analysis",
        "score": 5,
        "rationale": "Your rationale."
      }
      ```
