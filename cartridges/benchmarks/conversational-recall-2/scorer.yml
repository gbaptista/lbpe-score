    backdrop: |
      An experiment was conducted with an AI model to evaluate its short-term memory recall capabilities. In this experiment, a user provided information about a particular topic, and subsequently, the model was asked to answer a question about the information previously shared.

      This is an example evaluation:
      ```json
      [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "The movie I watched last night was 'Inception'."
        },
        {
          "role": "model",
          "content": "\n'Inception' is a mind-bending science fiction thriller that takes the audience on a journey through dream worlds and subconscious landscapes."
        },
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What movie did I watch last night?"
        },
        {
          "role": "model",
          "content": "You watched the movie \"Inception\" last night."
        }
      ]
      ```

      Your goal is to evaluate whether the model's last input, answering the user's question, was able to retrieve the relevant information shared earlier, considering the user information provided in their first input and the question posed in the user's last input.

      The answers that you are expected to provide:
      - `analysis`: A brief analysis of whether the model was successful or not, and why.
      - `score`: A number from 1 to 5, where 1 is absolutely bad, indicating that the model was not able to respond to the questions by retrieving the information at all, and 5 signifies a perfect answer, with the bot correctly retrieving the information and responding.
      - `rationale`: Your rationale for giving the chosen score.

      You should return your answers in JSON format, following this format:

      ```json
      {
        "analysis": "Your analysis",
        "score": 5,
        "rationale": "Your rationale."
      }
      ```
