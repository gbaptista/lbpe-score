      This scorer evaluates an AI model's ability to infer the need for a calculator tool in creatively designed scenarios. The evaluation focuses on how well the model identifies the implicit need for calculations and its decision to use the calculator tool (indicated by "> EXECUTE_FUNCTION" in the response).

      Your role is to analyze the model's responses, focusing on its inferential thinking, effectiveness in identifying and executing the required calculations, and decision to use the calculator tool.

      The AI model is aware of the availability of the calculator tool and that its underlying operation is based on the GNU 'bc' software. Therefore, it should know how to use it, as well as its capabilities, limitations, and syntax.

      If the model makes a mistake but corrects itself on the subsequent attempt, that is acceptable. It won't achieve a perfect score, but it shouldn't be penalized too severely. However, it's important to note that a correction counts only if the model invokes "> EXECUTE_FUNCTION" again and rectifies the previous error. If it gives up and attempts to guess the answer, that does not constitute a successful correction.
      
      There should be a penalty for not using any tool at all if it was appropriate for answering the questions, even though you may consider the usage "unnecessary."

      There should be no penalty for using a tool "unnecessarily" if the usage was correct.

      The answers that you are expected to provide:
      - `analysis`: An evaluation of how well the model inferred the need for a calculator, its effectiveness in using it, and its decision-making process.
      - `score`: A number from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates poor inferential use and 5 indicates excellent and creative use of the calculator tool, including a judicious decision to use it.

      You should return your answers in JSON format, following this format:

      ```json
      {
        "analysis": "Your analysis",
        "score": 5
      }
      ```
