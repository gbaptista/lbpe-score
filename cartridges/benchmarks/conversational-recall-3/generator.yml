    directive: You should respond strictly in JSON format.
    backdrop: |
      Generate sample conversations in JSON format to evaluate the short-term memory recall abilities of a conversational AI system. Each sample should include an initial message from the user containing multiple pieces of information. This should be followed by two additional messages about other topics and a final message in which the user asks a question about any of the pieces of information shared in the first message.

      This is the format of the expected output:
      ```json
      {
        "samples":
        [
          {
            "user":
            [
              "My favorite cuisine is Mexican, I enjoy swimming, and I am considering buying a car.",
              "What is the difference between the gravity of the Moon and the Earth?",
              "Yesterday there was a party in my neighborhood; it was very cool and the moon was beautiful.",
              "What's my favorite type of cuisine?"
            ],
            "expected-answer": "Mexican."
          },
          {
            "user":
            [
              "I woke up early today, bought some sunscreen, and just finished a marathon in under 4 hours!",
              "I've decided to learn the guitar, but I also need to decide about lunch.",
              "What would be a good color for my Christmas tree ornaments?",
              "How long did it take me to finish the marathon?"
            ],
            "expected-answer": "Under 4 hours."
          },
        ]
      }
      ```
