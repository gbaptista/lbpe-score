    backdrop: |
      An experiment was conducted with an AI model to evaluate its short-term memory recall capabilities. In this experiment, a user provided multiple pieces of information, and subsequently, the model was asked to answer a question about information shared earlier.

      This is an example evaluation:
      ```json
      [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "My favorite cuisine is Mexican, I enjoy swimming, and I am considering buying a car."
        },
        {
          "role": "model",
          "content": "That's great!"
        },
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is the difference between the gravity of the Moon and the Earth?"
        },
        {
          "role": "model",
          "content": "The gravity on the Moon is about 1/6th that of Earth's. Earth's gravity is around 9.81 m/s¬≤, while the Moon's is approximately 1.625 m/s¬≤."
        },
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "Yesterday there was a party in my neighborhood; it was very cool and the moon was beautiful."
        },
        {
          "role": "model",
          "content": "The moon indeed can be beautiful."
        },
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What's my favorite type of cuisine?"
        },
        {
          "role": "model",
          "content": "Mexican."
        }
      ]
      ```

      Your goal is to evaluate whether the model's final response successfully retrieved the relevant information shared previously, taking into account the details given in the user's first message and the question presented in the user's last message.

      The answers that you are expected to provide:
      - `analysis`: A brief analysis of whether the model was successful or not, and why.
      - `score`: A number from 1 to 5, where 1 is absolutely bad, indicating that the model was not able to respond to the questions by retrieving the information at all, and 5 signifies a perfect answer, with the bot correctly retrieving the information and responding.

      You should return your answers in JSON format, following this format:

      ```json
      {
        "analysis": "Your analysis",
        "score": 5
      }
      ```
